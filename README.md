Purpose
This is a browser based game which was built using html, css and JavaScript.

Instructions
The game begins on a start page which gives brief instructions for the game, and a link to the actual game.

The player has a minute to collect all the coins, and must also avoid the ghosts. If a player fails to collect the coins within a minute, or collides with a ghost, they will lose the game and be taken to the "game over" page. But if they are able to collect the coins within a minute, and avoid the ghosts, they will win and be taken to the "win" page.

To move pacman the player must use the up, left, right and down arrows on their keyboard.


Improvements
Make the game closer to the original perhaps, with added features such as fruits and the ability to eat ghosts on certain occasions. Also make the game more aesthetically pleasing.
